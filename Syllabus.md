### Anonymity
As part of this class you will be required to set up a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). GitHub is a tool for collaborative code sharing and editing. During this course you will be submitting links to files you publicly place in your GitHub account. If you are concerned about preserving your anonymity you should set up an anonymous GitHub account and be careful not to include any information you do not want made available to peer evaluators. But I highly suggest you to have an original account, so you can use GitHub for future and create your own showcase in GitHub.
