# Fundamentals of Computational Thinking


- __Computer Science__ is all about problem solving using power of computation.
- There are various areas of study which follows the succinct definition above:
    - Software Engineering
    - Database Management
    - Computer Networks
    - Computer Graphics
    - Computer Simulation
    - Data Mining
    - CyberSecurity
    - Artificial Intelligence
    - Computational Application of other sciences

- __Computation__ is notation of series of steps that can be systematically followed for producing the answer to a certain type of problem (Algorithm).
- In order to solve a problem computationally, two things are needed: a ```representation``` that captures all the relevant aspects of the problem, and an ```algorithm``` that solves the problem by use of the representation.
- Any algorithm that correctly solves a given problem must solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time, otherwise it is of limited practical use.
- __Algorithm__ is a finite number of clearly described, unambiguous “doable” steps that can be systematically followed to produce a desired result for given input in a finite amount of time.
- Because computers can execute instructions very quickly and reliably without error, algorithms and computers are a perfect match.
